# cocoon_simple_form_demo

[cocoon](http://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon) is a Rails3 gem to allow easier handling of nested forms.

This is a small demo that shows cocoon in action together with slim and simple_form.

Cocoon is formbuilder-agnostic, so it works with standard Rails, or Formtastic or simple_form.


## Notes

Formtastic is easier to start with, because it has a default css. Instead of slapping my own css
over the application, i formatted the forms very basically using tables. That is ugly as hell, i know,
but it was the fastest way to get it rolling (for now).
